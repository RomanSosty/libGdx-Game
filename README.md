# ReadMe
My first attempt to create a game using the libGDX library.
This game has no purpose, it is only to test the functions of the libGDX library and to improve my skills in Java and especially in writing clean code.

If you read my code, I welcome your feedback and advice.

### Control game
You can move around using the WSAD keyboard and perform an attack using the SPACE key. 
Enemies can hit you and take 20% of your health.
